# Deploying to Elastic Beanstalk

## Production environments

There are two production-level environments for the AIS API: *ais-api-market*
and *ais-api-broad*. Generally, you shouldn't deploy directly to a production
environment. Deployments are managed by the [Travis](https://travis-ci.org)
continuous integration service. The master branch is automatically deployed
when it changes on GitHub.

## Development environments

You can also create your own development environment.

### Getting set up with Elastic Beanstalk

Before you get started with Elastic Beanstalk, you'll have to install the `eb`
command line client, and configure your credentials. The CLI tool is installed
with:

```bash
pip install awsebcli awscli
```

*(Note that the AWS CLI is a different tool and the EB CLI, and both are
installed above)*

You can find credentials for working with the CLI in the IAM settings of the
AWS console. If you want to use the CLI from your own work machine, look up your
username at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#users; if you are using the
CLI from a different machine, consider creating a new user. Any given set of
credentials should ideally only be used in one place so that they can be easily
and quickly deactivated if necessary with minimal impact.

If you don't have an IAM key pair, create one. Once you have your AWS key and
secret, you can configure your CLI credentials with:

```bash
aws configure --profile phila
```

This will set up your credentials in a profile named `phila`. This is the
profile that the AIS repository is configured to look for by default, and is
named `phila` so that it does not interfere with any other credentials you may
have installed on your machine.

Now you're ready to deploy.

### Deploying a development application

There are a couple of saved configurations that you can choose to work from.
These configurations are saved on AWS and can be retrieved by running:

```bash
eb config list
```

To create a new environment for demoing a development branch, you can run, for
example:

```bash
eb create mynewdevenv --cfg ais-api-dev-sc
```

In the example above, `mynewdevenv` is the name of the new environment that I
am creating, and `ais-api-dev-sc` is the name of the saved configuration that I
am basing the environment on.

Once you have your test environment, you may want to specify what database it
reads from. You can do that by setting the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` environment
variable:

```bash
eb setenv -e mynewtestenv "SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=postgresql://dbuser:dbpass@ais-engine-db-dev.subdomain.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/ais_engine"
```

Now if you run `eb printenv mynewtestenv` you should see the variable set.

Finally, do deploy a particular branch to that development environment, check
out that branch and run the following:

```bash
eb deploy mynewtestenv
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

There are a few environment variables that need to be set for an instance of
the API. These have default variables set in the save configurations, but you
may want to override them.

`SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` -- The URL to the AIS database.

`SQLALCHEMY_POOL_SIZE` -- How many connections to the database each worker should
    keep open. To see how many connections your PostgreSQL database allows, run
    `select * from pg_settings where name='max_connections';`.

For deployment purposes, there is also a variable named `EB_BLUEGREEN_STATUS`.
The three respected values for this variable are `Production`, `Staging`, and
`Swap`. You should *not* set this variable for development instances.

### Scaling

The EC2 machines in the *ais-api-market* and *ais-api-broad* environments are
in auto scaling groups that are triggered by the average CPU usage across the
machines. If the machines are using more than an average 70% of their CPU for
5 minutes, the group will scale up. It will scale back down if the average is
lower than 40%.

**Guidelines around deployment variables:**

* There should be exactly one environment marked with a status of Production,
  and exactly one marked with a status of either Staging or Swap.
* New data is always deployed to the environment marked Staging or Swap.
* For tests, use the environment with a status of Production, unless there is
  an environment with a status of Swap.
* For code deployment, deploy to the same environment as is used for tests.
  If deploying to a Swap environment, then the final step in the deploy is to
  swap out the production environment for the test one.


## Deploying the database to RDS

The *scripts/update_db.sh* script can be used to run the engine update process.
This process entails:

1. Uploading the new database to the non-live production environment (*broad* or
   *market*),
2. Marking the non-live production environment as being ready to swap with the
   live one,
3. Running the API application tests against the database, and finally
4. Swapping the live environment, if the tests pass.

The last two steps are done on Travis CI. If the tests fail, the non-live
environment will remain in a ready-to-swap state until the tests pass again, at
which point Travis will make the swap.

**NOTE: If the machines ever get out of sync with their `EB_BLUEGREEN_STATUS`,
  you can set this variable on the environments manually using `eb config set`
  (see below).**
